What flies without eyes and cries without eyes?
I'm always hungry and must be fed, the finger I touch will soon turn red, what am I?
What has a bed but doesn't sleep and a mouth but never eats?
I have a brother that you can see but not hear. When I come after my brother and you can hear me but not see me. What am I?
Who makes it, has no need of it. Who buys it, has no use for it. Who uses it doesn't know it. What is it?
I have seas without water, coasts without sand, towns without people and mountains without land. What am I?
I don't have eyes, but once I did see. Once I had thoughts, but now I'm white and empty. What am I?
I can be written, I can be spoken, I can be exposed, I can be broken. What am I?
This old one runs forever but never moves at all. It has no lungs but has a mighty roar. What am I?
I go up and I go down, towards the sky and the ground. I'm present and past tense too. What am I?
