What is always coming but never arrives?
I am black when clean and white when dirty. What am I?
Sometimes I walk in front of you. Sometimes I walk behind you. It is only in the dark that I ever leave you. What am I?
What comes down but never goes up?
What has a bed but doesn't sleep and a mouth but never eats?
I'm always hungry and must be fed, the finger I touch will soon turn red, what am I?
I can't be seen but I'm not a ghost. I can crack but I don't break. I can clap but I don't have any hands. I happen after a flash but I'm not a photo. I'm loud but I'm not music. What am I?
Who makes it, has no need of it. Who buys it, has no use for it. Who uses it doesn't know it. What is it?
I have seas without water, coasts without sand, towns without people and mountains without land. What am I?
I don't have eyes, but once I did see. Once I had thoughts, but now I'm white and empty. What am I?
